Function Description
This function searches for the Google Sheets spreadsheet ID passed as a parameter, then looks for the sheet name and performs data insertions with the parameters passed (which must be a list of JSON).

Installation
To install this function, simply add it to your Google Sheets extensions and select the App Script. Once there, you have the option to create a script. This function is designed to help you perform dynamic inserts without worrying about their order, which is a very important factor when dealing with Excel spreadsheets.
